### Version

Version 0.1.1

### Installing

Head to your minecraft folder with your file browser (on Windows, for example, the folder can be found under the path `%APPDATA%\.minecraft` by default) and inside that folder create a folder called `Splatoon`. After that, download a zip of this repository (https://github.com/TrojanerHD/Minetoon/archive/master.zip), open it with a archive file manager (for example 7zip), go into `Minetoon-master`, select everything in this file, copy that and paste it into the folder you just created. Now you can run Minecraft and the world should appear in the world selection menu.
